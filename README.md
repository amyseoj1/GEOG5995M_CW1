# Coursework 1 Resit 

The current Agent Based Model (ABM) was created for the coursework 1 of GEOG5995M, which asks to compile a portfolio of practicals. The model first asks the user to define the number of agents and the number of iterations. Then, 'in.txt' file that contains the agents' environment is imported. The coordinates of agents will be randomly generated and placed on a 300 by 300 grid, and they will move around and interact with the environment. The agents continues movement until everyone eat up 100 spaces and stops automatically. The model generates an animation plot displaying agents moving around. As the final step, the model writes out the environment as a csv file. 

# Files 

The repository contains 4 files. agentframework.py must be ran prior to animatedmodel.py file. in.txt must be placed in the same directory. environmentout.csv file is added as an example to show how this model writes out a file.
